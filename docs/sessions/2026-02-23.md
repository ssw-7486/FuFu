# Session — 2026-02-23

## Summary

Resumed work on the nav wordmark after a previous session was cut off.

## Changes

### `mochi-app/components/Nav.tsx`

1. **Removed trailing period from tagline**
   - `from bean to box.` → `from bean to box`

2. **Responsive wordmark**
   - Mobile (`< sm`): displays `mochi` only — tight `viewBox="0 0 150 60"`, no tagline
   - Desktop (`sm+`): displays full `mochi | from bean to box` wordmark
   - Implemented via two SVGs toggled with Tailwind (`sm:hidden` / `sm:block`)

### `CLAUDE.md` (new)

3. **Initialized project context file** at repo root
   - Stack, dev server command, component map
   - Full design token reference (colors, type scale, layout)
   - Wordmark specs
   - Sessions folder convention

### Packaging — Front & Back Panels (new)

4. **Marketing copy brief** — `docs/marketing/PACKAGING_COPY_BRIEF.md`
   - Full copy for all 3 SKUs (5 lb / 10 lb / 20 lb stand-up pouches)
   - Front: headline, subline, benefit callouts, SKU flags, trust marks
   - Back: origin story, Why Tofu blocks, testimonials, how to use, footer
   - Per-SKU differentiation: "starter size" (5 lb), clean (10 lb), "best value" + multi-cat callout (20 lb)

5. **Design spec** — `docs/brand/PACKAGING_DESIGN_SPEC.md`
   - Bag dimensions, zone layouts, CMYK color values, print type scale
   - Cat illustration direction (static adaptation of Hero.tsx SVG)
   - Particle density as SKU differentiator (3 / 5 / 7)
   - Production handoff notes (font outlines, dieline, barcode, ICC profile)

6. **Packaging preview** — `docs/brand/packaging-preview.html`
   - Self-contained HTML mockup of all 6 panels (front + back × 3 SKUs)
   - Brand colors, Inter type, cat illustration from Hero.tsx

7. **Tagline enforcement** — "from bean to box" locked as mandatory on all surfaces
   - Fixed preview: tagline now visible (larger sizes, `#6E6E73` color, no opacity)
   - Rule added to: `MOCHI_BRAND_GUIDELINES.md`, `PACKAGING_DESIGN_SPEC.md`, `PACKAGING_COPY_BRIEF.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
   - Only permitted exception: mobile nav (`< sm` viewport)
