# Session — 2026-02-23

## Summary

Resumed work on the nav wordmark after a previous session was cut off.

## Changes

### `mochi-app/components/Nav.tsx`

1. **Removed trailing period from tagline**
   - `from bean to box.` → `from bean to box`

2. **Responsive wordmark**
   - Mobile (`< sm`): displays `mochi` only — tight `viewBox="0 0 150 60"`, no tagline
   - Desktop (`sm+`): displays full `mochi | from bean to box` wordmark
   - Implemented via two SVGs toggled with Tailwind (`sm:hidden` / `sm:block`)

## Commits

- `59513d8` fix(nav): responsive wordmark — mochi only on mobile, full tagline on sm+
