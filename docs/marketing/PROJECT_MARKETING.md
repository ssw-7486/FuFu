## 1. Brand Name Shortlist

Five candidates, each with rationale and tone conveyance.

---

### 1. **Tofupaws**
- **Rationale**: Direct product-to-brand clarity. "Tofu" signals plant-based origin immediately; "paws" anchors it in pet. Easy to remember, search-friendly, works across channels.
- **Tone**: Friendly, approachable, playful.

### 2. **Sproutbox**
- **Rationale**: "Sprout" evokes natural growth and plant origin. "Box" is the universal shorthand for litter box. Clean, modern, slightly abstract — room to grow into a broader pet wellness brand.
- **Tone**: Fresh, modern, slightly premium. DTC and design-forward.

### 3. **Cloverclean**
- **Rationale**: Clover communicates natural and botanical. Clean addresses the functional job directly. Together: earthy and efficacy-focused.
- **Tone**: Wholesome, trustworthy, practical with a natural edge.

### 4. **Fieldsift**
- **Rationale**: "Field" evokes the soybean agricultural origin. "Sift" is the core physical action of litter — functional, precise. Unusual enough to be ownable.
- **Tone**: Confident, clean, quietly premium.

### 5. **Purepad**
- **Rationale**: "Pure" signals cleanliness, safety, and natural ingredients. "Pad" adds a modern, minimal feel. Short, easy to spell, strong trademark potential.
- **Tone**: Premium, minimal, clean.

**Brand name confirmed: mochi.** The shortlist above is retained for reference. All copy going forward uses mochi.

## 2. Brand Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Personality Traits

1. **Honest and direct** — One claim per sentence. If it can't be said simply, the idea isn't ready.
2. **Warmly informed** — We know the science. We write like a person, not a label.
3. **Quietly confident** — No exclamation marks. No "amazing." The product speaks; copy clarifies.
4. **Grounded in real life** — We write for the person scooping at 7am, not an aspirational persona.

---

### Apple-Style Copy Principles (Mandatory)

These rules govern every word we publish — headline, caption, product page, or ad.

1. **Lead with the benefit, always.** First sentence tells the reader what they get — not what the product is. Wrong: "mochi is a tofu-based cat litter." Right: "No smell. No dust. No clay."
2. **One idea per sentence.** Do not combine two claims. Give each claim room to land.
3. **Cut every word that doesn't carry weight.** If removing a word doesn't change the meaning, remove it.
4. **Bold the claim, prove it briefly.** Headline = the promise. Body = the proof. CTA = what's next.
5. **Sentences end with the strongest word.** "Made from soybeans, not clay." Not "Not clay — made from soybeans."
6. **Never explain what you just said.** If a claim needs a follow-up sentence to decode it, rewrite the claim.

---

### Writing Do's

- "Made from soybean pulp." Not "proprietary plant-derived substrate."
- "Clumps in 30 seconds." Not "fast-acting formula."
- "Flush it. Compost it. It breaks down either way." Not "environmentally responsible disposal options."
- Second person throughout: "your cat," "your home."
- Active voice. Always.

### Writing Don'ts

- Never write "sustainable" without a specific proof point immediately after.
- No guilt. No lecturing. Eco benefit follows consumer benefit — it never leads.
- No jargon: "holistic," "synergy," "solution," "ecosystem" (unless literal).
- No hyperbole: "best," "revolutionary," "game-changing." If a competitor could say it, cut it.
- No slow openings. If the first sentence could be deleted without losing anything, delete it.

---

### How We Talk About Eco/Sustainability

**The rule: one specific fact beats any vague claim.**

Wrong: "Help save the planet with every scoop."
Right: "Made from soybean pulp — the byproduct of tofu production. Nothing mined. Nothing synthetic."

Wrong: "Be a responsible pet parent and go green."
Right: "Flush it or compost it. It breaks down either way."

**The frame: "Better for your cat. Better for the earth — that's the bonus."** Consumer benefit first. Environmental benefit is the reward, not the obligation.

## 3. Core Messaging Pillars

Each pillar is structured as: **Bold claim → one-sentence expansion → proof points.**

---

### Pillar 1: Nothing in it that shouldn't be.
**Expansion**: Made from soybean pulp. No clay, no silica dust, no synthetic fragrance — nothing added that isn't necessary.

**Proof Points**:
- Soybean pulp byproduct of tofu production — no new resources extracted.
- Free from clay, silica, artificial fragrance, and chemical binders.
- Non-toxic if ingested — safe for curious cats and children.

---

### Pillar 2: Natural. And it actually works.
**Expansion**: Fast clumping. Odor gone at the source. Less mess on the floor.

**Proof Points**:
- Forms solid clumps in under 30 seconds.
- Natural soybean enzymes neutralize ammonia — no masking, no perfume.
- Low-dust, low-tracking pellet design. Floors stay cleaner between scoops.

---

### Pillar 3: When you're done, it's done.
**Expansion**: Flush it, compost it, bin it. It disappears. Clay litter doesn't.

**Proof Points**:
- Flushable in small quantities — septic and sewer safe.
- Fully compostable in home compost systems.
- Biodegradable packaging — minimal plastic end-to-end.

---

### Pillar 4: Costs less per scoop than clay.
**Expansion**: Lighter bags. Efficient clumping. Less wasted per cycle.

**Proof Points**:
- Less weight per scoop means each bag lasts longer than equivalent clay.
- Efficient clumping reduces the amount of litter used per month.
- Subscription pricing cuts per-unit cost further.

## 4. Tagline Options

---

1. **"Clean starts here."**
   Rationale: Double meaning — clean home and clean ingredients. Works on packaging, ads, and social. The recommended launch tagline.

2. **"No clay. No smell. No compromise."**
   Rationale: Three-beat Apple-style structure. Each word earns its place. Objection-handling built into the tagline.

3. **"Better litter. Naturally."**
   Rationale: Directly comparative without naming a competitor. "Naturally" does dual work — "of course" and "using natural ingredients."

4. **"From bean to box."**
   Rationale: Tells the origin story in four words. Strong for social storytelling and product packaging callouts.

5. **"Your cat doesn't care. You will."**
   Rationale: Disarming opener, immediate pivot to owner benefit. Confident and slightly witty — strong digital ad performer.

**Recommended for launch: "Clean starts here."** — clear, ownable, and zero explanation required.

**Runner-up: "No clay. No smell. No compromise."** — strongest for paid digital where the first line must stop the scroll.

## 5. Value Propositions Per Audience Segment

Each is written to land in five seconds. One punch. No buildup.

---

### Eco-Conscious Millennials (Ages 25-40)

**One-liner**: Made from the byproduct of tofu production. Flush it. Compost it. Nothing goes to landfill.

**Full value prop**:
It starts as soybean pulp — what's left after tofu is made. No new resources. No synthetic chemicals. When you're done, flush or compost it. The daily habit that already costs you nothing becomes one that costs the planet nothing either.

**Key hooks**: Circular economy origin. Zero-synthetic ingredient list. Flushable and compostable end-of-life. Lifestyle alignment.

---

### Budget-Conscious Families

**One-liner**: Lasts longer. Clumps faster. Costs less per month than clay.

**Full value prop**:
Lighter bags. Fewer scoops wasted. Less mess to clean up. And because it's made from plants — not clay — it's safe if your kid or kitten gets into it. Better performance at a comparable price.

**Key hooks**: Price-per-use advantage over clay. Clumping efficiency. Child and pet safety. Lightweight and easy to carry.

---

### Premium Pet Parents

**One-liner**: Food-grade ingredients. Zero silica dust. Made for cats you actually care about.

**Full value prop**:
What goes in the litter box matters as much as what goes in the bowl. Our ingredients are food-grade. No clay dust, no silica, no synthetic fragrance. Natural enzymes handle odor. Nothing toxic, nothing synthetic — just clean.

**Key hooks**: Food-grade standard positioning. Zero silica dust. Vet-safe, non-toxic formula. Premium brand identity.

## 6. Social Media Style Guide

---

### Instagram

**Visual Tone**
- Earthy but elevated. Warm neutrals — oat, sage, cream, soft terracotta — against clean white or linen backgrounds.
- Natural light, real homes, real cats. Carefully composed, not studio-perfect.
- Product shots: minimal props, sharp focus, pellet texture visible — the texture is a proof point, show it.
- Avoid: heavy filters, cold/blue-toned, or anything that looks synthetic.

**Caption Style — Apple Rules Applied**
- First line must hook. It must make someone stop scrolling. Do not warm up to the point.
- One idea per caption. Pick one claim and prove it. Do not try to say everything.
- 2-5 lines maximum in the body. Use line breaks. Never dump a paragraph.
- CTA last: one clear action ("Link in bio." / "Drop your question below.").
- Tone: direct, warm, slightly dry. Never corporate.

**Hashtag Strategy**
- 6-10 per post. Not 30.
- Formula: 2 brand + 3 niche community + 2-3 category + 1 broad reach.
- Example: #mochilitter #cleanstarthere + #ecofriendlypets #sustainablepetcare #naturalcatlitter + #catlitter #tofucatlitter + #catsofinstagram
- Own from day one: #mochicat and #cleanstarthere.

**Content Themes (rotate weekly)**
- Ingredient Story — what's in it and why it matters (one specific fact per post)
- Cat Moment — real cats, real homes, UGC or brand lifestyle shot
- Behind the Clean — how it works: clumping, odor control, flush/compost
- Community — customer reviews, testimonials, UGC reshares
- Earth Note — one environmental fact, short and specific, never preachy

---

### TikTok

**Content Format Ideas**
- Ingredient reveal: clay ingredients vs. tofu ingredients on screen, side by side.
- Clumping close-up: satisfying slow-motion clump formation — high watch-through completion.
- "I switched. Here's what happened." — 30-second real-world test result.
- Myth-bust: "Eco litter doesn't perform. Let's test that."
- Cat reaction: first encounter with the new litter, texture exploration, scent check.

**Tone**
- Casual, direct, slightly self-aware.
- Native content outperforms branded polish on TikTok. Slightly rough is right.
- Humor is allowed — the absurdity of caring this much about cat litter is the bit. Lean in.

**Hook Styles — First 2 Seconds Make or Break**
- Problem-open: "Your litter box is probably the most toxic spot in your home."
- Skeptic-open: "I didn't believe plant-based litter worked. So I ran the test."
- Contrast-open: "Clay litter vs. tofu litter. One scoop. Real result."
- Stakes-open: "Most cat owners don't know what's in their cat's litter. I didn't either."

**Hook 2 — Skeptic Test**
Opening line: *"Plant-based cat litter doesn't work. I said that too. Then I ran a 48-hour test."*
