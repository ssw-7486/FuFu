# mochi Packaging Copy Brief
### Physical Bag — Front & Back Panels
### SKUs: 5 lb / 10 lb / 20 lb Stand-Up Pouches
### Version 1.0 — February 2026

---

## Document Purpose

This brief defines every word that appears on the physical packaging for all three mochi litter bag SKUs. It is production-ready and intended to be handed directly to the design team with no ambiguity. Locked copy elements are marked **[LOCKED]**. Flexible elements are marked **[FLEX]** — these may be adjusted for layout without changing the core claim. All copy adheres to the mochi brand voice: confident, clean, no fluff.

---

# FRONT PANEL

---

## Shared Front Panel Elements (All SKUs)

These elements appear identically across all three bags. See per-SKU section for differentiated copy.

---

### Wordmark Placement

**[LOCKED]**

- Position: Upper-left corner, or centered top — designer's choice based on pouch proportions. Never centered-middle.
- Lockup: mochi wordmark + tagline lockup below: *from bean to box*
- Wordmark color: Deep Sage (#2D6A4F) on Warm Cream background; white on Deep Sage background panels
- Tagline: Inter Light, wide tracking, one size step below the wordmark
- Clear space: maintain clear space equal to the cap height of the "m" on all four sides of the lockup
- Do not append "cat litter" to the wordmark — the product category line handles this separately

---

### Product Category Line

**[LOCKED]**

> tofu cat litter

- Placement: Directly below or adjacent to the wordmark lockup
- Style: Inter Regular, muted text color (#6E6E73), all lowercase, caption scale
- Purpose: Orients new buyers without cluttering the wordmark

---

### Hero Headline

**[LOCKED]**

> clean litter, finally.

- Placement: Center-front, dominant hierarchy — this is the primary visual element after the wordmark
- Style: Inter Bold (700), Deep Sage (#2D6A4F), display scale — largest type on the front panel
- Do not add punctuation beyond the period. Do not capitalize.
- This headline does not change across SKUs.

---

### Front Panel Subline

**[LOCKED]**

> Dust-free. Biodegradable. Made from soy.

- Placement: Directly beneath the hero headline, one step down in type scale
- Style: Inter Regular (400), Charcoal (#1D1D1F), body scale
- This is a three-beat factual statement. Do not reorder the claims. Do not replace with a sentence.

---

### Benefit Callouts (Icon-Adjacent)

Three callouts, arranged horizontally or in a vertical stack — designer's discretion based on pouch shape.

**[LOCKED — wording. FLEX — arrangement and icon style]**

Each callout pairs a short label with a supporting micro-line. The label is the claim; the micro-line is the proof. Do not run these together as a sentence.

| # | Icon Suggestion | Label | Micro-line |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Leaf / plant stem | **food-grade soy** | No clay. No silica. |
| 2 | Drop / clump form | **clumps on contact** | Firm. Dry. Easy to scoop. |
| 3 | Cycle / compost arrow | **gone in 60 days** | Flush it or compost it. |

- Icon style: Line icons, 1.5px stroke, Deep Sage or Charcoal. No filled icons. No color fills on the icons.
- Label: Inter SemiBold (600), Deep Sage
- Micro-line: Inter Regular (400), muted text (#6E6E73)
- Callout block background: optional subtle Warm Sand card if visual separation is needed — radius 4px, no border

---

### Trust Marks / Certification Badges

**[FLEX — confirm certifications before print]**

Badges to appear on the front panel, bottom-right zone or bottom strip:

- **Biodegradable** — use only if certified or with explicit claim basis
- **Dust-Free** — owner claim, no third-party cert required
- **Plant-Based** — owner claim
- **No Clay · No Silica · No Synthetic Fragrance** — this three-part negative claim may run as a horizontal badge strip in terracotta (#C8714F) or muted text — treat as a "what's not in it" trust bar

Designer note: These badges should feel like quiet proof points, not promotional callouts. No starbursts, no decorative borders. Small scale. Restrained.

---

## Per-SKU Front Panel Differentiation

---

### SKU 01 — 5 lb

**Positioning: Try it.**

**SKU Flag [LOCKED]**
> 5 lb — starter size

- Placement: Upper-right corner, or adjacent to the wordmark
- Style: Inter Medium (500), terracotta accent (#C8714F), label scale, slight letter-spacing
- This is the only SKU-specific front panel text — all other front elements are shared

**Designer note for 5 lb:** The starter flag should feel like an invitation, not a discount signal. Terracotta color conveys warmth and approachability. Do not use sale-adjacent visual language.

---

### SKU 02 — 10 lb

**Positioning: Everyday.**

**SKU Flag [LOCKED]**
> 10 lb

- Style: Inter Medium (500), Deep Sage, label scale
- No additional descriptor needed — the weight speaks to the regular-use buyer

**Designer note for 10 lb:** This is the workhorse SKU. Front panel should feel settled and confident. No special flag language beyond the weight.

---

### SKU 03 — 20 lb

**Positioning: Built for more.**

**SKU Flag [LOCKED]**
> 20 lb — best value

- Placement: Upper-right corner
- Style: Inter Medium (500), terracotta accent (#C8714F), label scale
- "best value" is the only promotional qualifier used across all SKUs — use sparingly and at small scale

**Designer note for 20 lb:** Slightly more generous white space on this bag to match the larger format. The bag itself signals volume — the design should not overwork it.

---

---

# BACK PANEL

---

## Shared Back Panel Elements (All SKUs)

All back panel copy is shared across SKUs unless the per-SKU section specifies a variation.

---

### Origin Story

**[LOCKED — trim to ~60 words. Do not alter the key facts.]**

> Most cat litter comes from strip-mined clay or silica. We asked a different question: what if it could come from something that already exists?
>
> Tofu production creates a soy byproduct that would otherwise be discarded. We turned it into something clean. mochi is plant-based, dust-free, and biodegradable — made from food-grade ingredients your cat won't mind and the planet doesn't cost.

Word count: 67 words. Designer may request a 55-word trim — see flexible trim guidance below.

**55-word trim version [FLEX — use if space requires]:**

> Most cat litter is strip-mined clay or silica. We asked: what if it came from something already made?
>
> Tofu production creates a soy byproduct that would otherwise be discarded. We turned it into mochi — plant-based, dust-free, biodegradable, and made from food-grade ingredients. Better for your cat. Better for the earth.

- Style: Inter Regular (400), Charcoal (#1D1D1F), body scale, flush-left
- Do not center-align this paragraph block
- Line length target: 60–70 characters per line

---

### Why Tofu — 3 Benefit Blocks

**[LOCKED — headline and first sentence. FLEX — second sentence if space is tight.]**

Three blocks arranged in a column or a 3-up horizontal row. Each block = bold headline + 1–2 sentences.

---

**Block 1 — Ingredient**

**food-grade soy**
Made from the same soy used in tofu production. No clay, no silica, no synthetic fragrance — nothing added that doesn't belong.

---

**Block 2 — Performance**

**clumps on contact**
Forms tight, dry clumps in seconds. Easy to scoop. Low tracking. Your floors stay clean between scoops.

---

**Block 3 — End of Life**

**gone in 60 days**
Fully biodegradable. Flush it or compost it. Nothing goes to landfill.

---

**Block typographic spec:**
- Headline: Inter SemiBold (600), Deep Sage (#2D6A4F), H3 scale
- Body: Inter Regular (400), Charcoal (#1D1D1F), body scale
- Inter-block spacing: 24px minimum
- Optional: thin 1px Deep Sage left border on each block for visual separation — restrained, not decorative

---

### Testimonials

Two testimonials selected for punchy, specific, non-generic content. Both trimmed for print.

**[FLEX — trim for space. Do not alter attribution.]**

---

**Testimonial 1**

> "Switched from clay six months ago. The dust difference alone was worth it."
> — Sarah M., San Francisco

---

**Testimonial 2**

> "I was skeptical. It actually clumps better than the brand I used for years."
> — James T., Brooklyn

---

**Testimonial typographic spec:**
- Quote: Inter Regular (400) or Light (300), italic, Charcoal (#1D1D1F), body-small scale
- Attribution: Inter Regular (400), muted text (#6E6E73), caption scale
- Opening quote mark: oversized, Deep Sage (#2D6A4F), display scale — optional decorative element, use only if space allows and does not crowd copy
- No box, no card, no border around testimonials — let white space frame them

---

### Usage Instructions

**[LOCKED]**

> Fill box 2–3 inches deep. Scoop daily. To dispose: flush small amounts or add to compost. Replace fully every 4–6 weeks.

- Style: Inter Regular (400), muted text (#6E6E73), caption scale
- Placement: below benefit blocks, above legal/barcode zone
- Label it: **how to use** in Inter Medium (500), Deep Sage, all lowercase, above the instruction line

---

### Wordmark + Tagline Lockup (Back Panel Footer)

**[LOCKED]**

- Placement: Bottom-center of back panel, above barcode and legal line
- Lockup: mochi wordmark + *from bean to box* tagline, same spec as front
- Color: Deep Sage on light background
- This lockup closes the back panel — it is the final brand impression before the barcode. Give it breathing room.

---

### Website / Social Handle

**[FLEX — update with confirmed handles before print]**

> mochilitter.com
> @mochilitter

- Style: Inter Regular (400), muted text (#6E6E73), caption scale
- Placement: Adjacent to or beneath the back-panel wordmark lockup
- Do not include QR code at this stage unless requested separately

---

### Legal / Barcode Zone

**[FLEX — placeholder for legal copywriter and printer spec]**

Reserve a horizontal strip at the very bottom of the back panel for:
- Net weight declaration (required — e.g., "NET WT 5 LB (2.27 KG)")
- Country of origin
- Barcode (UPC)
- Legal boilerplate / manufacturer address

Designer note: This zone should be treated as a functional footer. No brand color fills, no decorative elements. Charcoal text on white or light cream background only.

---

## Per-SKU Back Panel Differentiation

---

### SKU 01 — 5 lb

Add a single callout block beneath the origin story or adjacent to the testimonials:

**[LOCKED]**

> **new to mochi?**
> Most cats switch without noticing. Start here.

- Style: Inter Medium (500) headline, Inter Regular body, Deep Sage headline, muted text body
- This block is exclusive to the 5 lb bag. Remove from all other SKUs.
- Purpose: reduces purchase hesitation for first-time buyers

---

### SKU 02 — 10 lb

No back panel differentiation required. All shared elements apply.

Back panel should feel balanced and settled. No callouts beyond the shared framework.

---

### SKU 03 — 20 lb

Add a single callout block in place of or adjacent to the starter callout:

**[LOCKED]**

> **for multi-cat homes**
> One bag. Up to 4–6 weeks per cat. Less to carry. Less to order.

- Style: Same spec as the 5 lb "new to mochi?" block above
- This block is exclusive to the 20 lb bag. Remove from all other SKUs.
- Purpose: justifies the larger format with a clear household benefit, not just a price per pound argument

# DESIGN TEAM NOTES

---

## Hierarchy Priority — Front Panel

1. Wordmark + tagline lockup (identity anchor)
2. Hero headline: *clean litter, finally.* (primary message)
3. Subline (three-fact confirmation)
4. SKU flag (size/positioning signal)
5. Benefit callouts (proof points — icon-adjacent)
6. Trust marks (quiet confidence builders — smallest scale)

Do not let the benefit callouts compete with the hero headline. The headline lands first. The callouts support.

---

## Hierarchy Priority — Back Panel

1. Origin story (the "why" — earns the brand)
2. Benefit blocks (the "what" — proves performance)
3. Testimonials (social proof — real people, real results)
4. How to use (functional necessity)
5. Wordmark lockup (brand close)
6. Website / social (action prompt)
7. Legal / barcode (compliance)

---

## Typography Reminders

- Line length for origin story and benefit blocks: 60–70 characters

---

## Color Reminders

- Deep Sage (#2D6A4F) is the hero color — headlines, labels, icon fills
- Terracotta (#C8714F) is an accent — SKU flags on 5 lb and 20 lb, optional trust bar
- Warm Cream (#FAF3E8) is the primary bag background surface
- Muted text (#6E6E73) for secondary copy: micro-lines, testimonial attribution, usage instructions, legal
- Do not introduce any color outside this palette without brand approval
- Maximum two colors visible on any single panel surface — Deep Sage and one other

---

## Sustainability Claims — Print Standards

All environmental claims on packaging must be supportable. Before final print approval, confirm:

- "Biodegradable in 60 days" — confirm test conditions and basis (home compost? industrial?)
- "Flushable" — confirm septic and sewer compatibility, note any volume limits in usage instructions
- "Food-grade ingredients" — confirm food-grade standard met for the specific manufacturing process
- "No synthetic fragrance" — confirm ingredient list

Flag any claim that cannot be substantiated to the marketing manager before artwork lock.

---

## Print Production Notes (For Printer Handoff)

- Bag type: Stand-up pouch with hang hole
- Finish recommendation: Matte laminate on Warm Cream base — maintains the premium-minimal feel, avoids plastic-glossy signal
- Terracotta accent elements: spot treatment acceptable, not required
- Deep Sage panel option: one face of the bag may use Deep Sage as the full-bleed background with reversed white wordmark — confirm with designer
- Bleed: 3mm standard bleed on all edges
- Safe zone: 5mm minimum from edge for all copy and logos
- Proof requirement: Physical print proof required before production run — color match to hex values above, particularly Deep Sage
